1371,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,Procedures for ranking causes of death The procedures used by NCHS for ranking causes of death are consistent with the recommendations of the 1951 Public Health Conference on Records and Statistics (2).
1372,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes.
1373,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,The number of deaths is used as the ranking criterion because it most accurately reflects the frequency of causespecific mortality.
1374,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,"Although crude death rates could technically be used as the ranking criterion because the population denominator of each rate is constant across all cause-of-death categories, these rates are less than ideal."
1375,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,This is especially problematic when ranking causes of death for small population subgroups or geographic areas because it may be impossible to differentiate the ranks for several causes.
1376,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,Age-adjusted death rates should never be used to rank causes of death.
1377,,test_pdfs/NCHS-Leading COD-Adolescents-2015-nvsr66_05.pdf, caus,"For example, when the standard age distribution gives more weight to the older population, the rank of causes of death that primarily affect the older population tends to be higher and the rank of causes that primarily affect the younger population tends to be lower."
